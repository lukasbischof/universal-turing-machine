# Universal Turing Machine

This is a Ruby implementation of a configurable turing machine, either using a descriptive
YAML configuration or using a binary encoding


### YAML Configuration

An example can be found [here](https://github.com/lukasbischof/universal-turing-machine/blob/master/configuration.yml)

### Binary

The binary file has a unary format, separated with a 1 between each field and with 11 after each statement
